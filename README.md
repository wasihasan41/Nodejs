single language for both frontend and backend.

client send _req_ server sends *res*

## why node js? as we have other backend languages too
we have to learn only js
as for frontend we must learn js by that our backend work is also fulfilled 
 
### npm (node package manager)

# installations
Install  node js from it official website 
go to specific folder using _cd_ command in the terminal
write _npm init_ (initialize the package for that project)
this will create _package.json_ file  
write _npm install <package_name_optional>_ or _npm i_ (it will install all dependencies and package-lock.json file will be created)

## pacakge.json
